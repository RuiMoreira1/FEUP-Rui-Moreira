# **The Last Chapter**

  The main goal of the ‘The Last Chapter’ project is the development of a web-based online book store where you can buy all your favorite books, from old classics to comic books, and find others that you’ll love. The store is managed by a team of administrators that ensure the correct flow of the website.


  Our central motivation is to offer a pleasant shopping experience where from the comfort of your own home you can order books that may not be available in your usual ‘street corner’ bookshop.

  “The Last Chapter” online shop will have an adaptive design, suitable for desktop or mobile, and provide an easy navigation system by grouping all the products by genre.

  The platform will have advanced search features, with filters/tags to be applied (author, book genres, price ranges, item rating) and partial and complete string search on a search bar (with autocomplete).

  Registered Users can keep a wishlist and view the history of their previous purchases (if they have any). Regarding the payment method, there are two types available (Paypal, Credit Card).

  When the user proceeds to checkout and the purchase is complete, the product will be approved for shipping, allowing the admins to change the order status.

  Each product will have a title, an image, one or more genres, a price, and an Author.

  In addition, each Book or eBook will also have a star rating, buyer reviews, general info about its editor and edition, and an applied discount at checkout defined by an administrator.

  A review includes a star rating and a short description written by a buyer, given that the product star rating will be calculated by the average of all the reviews’ star ratings.

As an additional feature, we would like to have a “random book” button that provides a suggestion based on your previously bought books and favorite genres.

On our website we have two main types of actors, administrators and users:
* Administrators' accounts are independent of the user accounts, to the extent that they cannot buy products. Their job is to manage the registered users, the products, all the orders, and view data of complete purchases.

* Users are divided into groups with different roles:

 * Non-registered users / “Guests” - they can search for and preview all the purchasable content including their reviews and add/remove items to/from their shopping cart

 * Registered users - they can perform the same actions as all non-registered users, but they are also allowed to checkout their shopping cart, view their purchase history, add/remove items to/from their wishlist and receive notifications. When they buy a product (user becomes a Buyer) they can track their order, cancel it or write a review that can later be edited or deleted.
